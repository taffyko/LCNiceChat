- Can now **scroll** through chat history (once there's enough history, just scroll with mousewheel while the chat input is active!)
	- Chat history is no longer limited to 4 messages
- Increases the 30 character message limit (default: 1000, configurable by host)
	- NOTE: For this, the mod also needs to be installed by the host.  
	Without it, the limit can only be increased to ~50.
	- _Apart from this, the mod is fully client-side._
- Increases the size of the chat area (toggleable)
	- Changes the default font size so that more text can fit (configurable)
- Removes the apostrophes (`'`) around chat messages.
- Can now use `Shift+Enter` to insert line breaks in your messages.
