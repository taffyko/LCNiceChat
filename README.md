All features work client-side unless otherwise mentioned.

- Can now **scroll** through chat history (once there's enough history, just scroll with mousewheel while the chat input is active!)
	- Chat history is no longer limited to 4 messages
	- A scrollbar shows your position in history (can be disabled in config)
- Increases the 30 character message limit (default: 1000, configurable by host)
	- NOTE: For this, the mod also needs to be installed by the host.  
	Without it, the limit can only be increased to ~50.
- Increases the size of the chat area (toggleable)
	- Changes the default font size so that more text can fit (configurable)
- Removes the apostrophes (`'`) around chat messages.
- Can now use `Shift+Enter` to insert line breaks in your messages.
- Messages you receive while the clock is visible will now have timestamps (can be disabled in config)
- You can now say the same thing multiple times in a row
	- NOTE: Only players with the mod installed will be able to see repeat messages
- Can configure the fade-out opacity of the chat (even making it fade away completely), and customize the amount of seconds before fading
